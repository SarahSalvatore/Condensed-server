## Introduction

CONDENSED is a URL shortener that converts long URL links to shorter, more concise links.

## How it Works

The original URL is represented by a 7 digit slug. The slug is created with nanoid and a hexidecimal numbering system with base 16. There are 4.29 billion possible combinations for slug creation.

Original URLs and slugs are stored in the database. Before creating a new slug, the request body is validated to ensure it is a legitimate URL, and that it does not previously exist within the database. If the URL is found within the database, the existing slug is returned. Slugs are generated by nanoid and checked against the database to ensure each one is unique.

## How to Use

To create a shortened URL link, users can paste their original URL into the input box and click the SHORTEN URL button. The new URL will appear on screen and can be tested by clicking the link itself and copied by clicking the clipboard icon.
